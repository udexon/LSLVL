2. LSLVL is one those very rare "such a wonderful yet simple, but no one has done it" idea:

- Instead of getting one teacher to make 100 videos to describe basic vocabularies in a second language, getting 100 students each to make 1 video to explain basic vocabularies, is more viable and interesting.
- 1 x 100 < 100 x 1 !!


3. One or more students, under the guidance of a teacher or tutor, make a short video, to demonstrate the usage and explanation of one or two new words, with one or two sentences.

- When a large number of such videos are made, we will create a "video dictionary" for a particular pair of languages (e.g. English-Chinese), with Duniix search engine.

- This will perhaps solve the hardest problem in learning a second language: lack of a complete, word by word, online video dictionary (with visuals and audio), for students to learn word by word.

- By engaging students to volunteer on making such video dictionaries (sponsorships are possible), we would have enough manpower to make video dictionaries for all possible language pairs in the world, covering every word in every language!!


4. LSLVL is only the beginning of a series of online training programs that we have planned with Duniix and FSBR (Free Software Business Revolution). We plan to expand the training contents to cover other subjects and disciplines, such as cooking, videography, programming and so on.

We shall promote the fundamental philosophy of free software in these online training programs, which is unique compared to other conventional training programs.


5. LSLVL will be able to engage a large number of students, of various levels of proficiency, from various backgrounds and ages, in many countries. They can become significant political forces, as they acquire novel understanding of the free software philosophy, as applied in business and politics.
