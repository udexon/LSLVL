# VL002 LSLVL as a Solution to "Forced to Startup"

"Forced to startup" (FTS) is perhaps a euphemism for "unemployment".
However FTS has its bright side, as it is not a total "hopium" (hope + opium).

Obviously if you are reading this, you might be one of the 
not so lucky majority, who are affected financially by COVID19 pandemic.

Then you are in luck, as we will show you how LSLVL may help you.

Or, if you are one of the lucky few who are not financially affected
by the COVID19 pandemic, then you may have a good chance
to improve your karma, so to speak, by helping others,
as we hope you will see one of the best startup business model
since, let's say, Kentucky Fried Chicken?

As we have highlighted many times elsewhere, in LSLVL:
- One or more students, under the guidance of a teacher or tutor, make a short video, to demonstrate the usage and explanation of one or two new words, with one or two sentences.
