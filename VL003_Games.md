1. Couplets or 对联 (Duilian) is one of the favourite language "games", enjoyed by people from Emperors (皇帝) to ordinary citizens (老百姓) .

If a foreigner (老外 Laowai) is able to play the couplet game, then you will be accepted as "one of us".


2. Since the passing of Mao Zedong 毛泽东, an accomplised poet himself, few political Duilians or Poems have been publicized, as by tradition, Duilians or Poems represent the perspective of a high ranking Mandarin or the even Emperor himself. Conversely, political Duilians or Poems become the highest form of art, as they will inspire and influence all Chinese 天下万民。

As such, we can only do this without interference outside China.

The secret recipe of this particular couplet is basically to contrast the 7 most influential historical figures of "Old China" (from Confucius to Chiang-Kai-Sek), versus the 7 most influential historical figures for "New China" (from Karl Marx to Deng-Xiaoping), each followed by a 4 character proverb (cheng2 yu3) that describes the ideals for China and the World.

To play the couplet game, one party usually disclose the first half of the couplet, to challenge the opponent to create a matching half. Also, you may hide the "theme" of the couplet, and ask the opponent to create one.


3. I suppose in any age throughout Chinese history, scholars would compete to create the First Couplet 天下第一联 of their age. Obviously, the Qing Dynasty has been infamous of the supression of Han literature. As such, famous couplets associated with the Han Rebellion 反清复明 were only circulated underground, and obivously known by the Imperial Secret Police.

The most famous political Couplet from the Qing Dynasty, according to Ludingji, woud be this Tiandihui (天地会 The Society of Heaven and Earth) couplet:

- 地镇高岗,一派溪山千古秀；
- 门朝大海,三河峡水万年流。

4. 天增歳月人增夀 春满乾坤福满門

5. It may be an innovative approach to learn Chinese by Couplets. Obviously this is not intended at beginners. However, regardless of the proficiency levels of the learners, we believe that the contents of these couplets may interest the readers, from the historical, politcal and cultural perspectives. It is a bit like learning English by reciting Shapkespeare's. It may take ages for the learners to completely appreciate the source, but it does give the learners something interesting to look forward to.
